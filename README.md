i'm akshit.

most recently, i had co-founded a health-tech startup, [cogny solutions](https://cognysolutions.com) and worked with [access for everyone](https://a4e.org.in). before that, i held senior tech roles at [lvb](https://locatevictimsbeirut.org) and [sakshi](https://sakshi.org.in).

i have designed and developed web platforms for social causes, companies, and organizations from all over. in my free time, i love tinkering with data science and ml algorithms. in every endeavour, i strive to blend creativity with tech, crafting user-centric solutions. whether it's championing a new initiative or diving deep into code, my passion lies in turning complex challenges into seamless digital results.
