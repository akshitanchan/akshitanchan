i'm akshit. most recently, i had co-founded a health-tech startup, [cogny solutions](https://cognysolutions.com) and worked with [access for everyone](https://a4e.org.in). before that, i held senior tech roles at [lvb](https://locatevictimsbeirut.org) and [sakshi](https://sakshi.org.in).

i’ve designed and built web platforms for social causes, companies, and organizations around the world. in my free time, i like tinkering with data science and ml. i try to bring creativity into everything i do, building user-first solutions. whether i’m backing a new initiative or going deep in the code, i love turning messy, complex problems into clean, seamless digital experiences.
