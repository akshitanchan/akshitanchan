### Hey everyone! 👋🏼

<a href="https://akshit.org"><img align="right" src="assets/akshit-octocat.png" width=200></a>

I'm Akshit Anchan, a third-year university student, studying towards my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering. I'm from Dubai 🇦🇪 and Mumbai 🇮🇳! I use HTML, JS, CSS, Python, and SQL. I'm fairly decent in C, C++, and Java as well. I'm an advocate for many causes and consistently work in Tech For Good projects.

### What I'm Up To

Currently, I am Co-Founder at a social tech-startup, [Beiyouth](https://beiyouth.com), Head of Tech at a youth initiative, [Access for Everyone](https://a4e.org.in), and [freelance](https://akshitanchan.com) in full stack development. I also assume similar roles at my uni's Google Developer Student Club and Girl Up chapters. I've previously held senior tech-roles at [Locate Victims Beirut](https://locatevictimsbeirut.org) and [Sakshi](https://sakshi.org.in).

I have designed/developed web platforms for social causes, companies, and organizations from all over. I'm a Creative Developer; a more recent role in tech that looks to blur the lines between a coder and a designer, using coding languages to create accessible, beautiful, and interactive web interfaces, sites, and applications. In my free time, I [write](https://akshitanchan.com/blog) (curating the best of what I've seen, read or noticed), [develop](https://akshitanchan.com) and love tinkering with Data Science and ML algorithms.
