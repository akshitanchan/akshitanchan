i'm akshit. most recently, i had co-founded a health-tech startup, [cogny solutions](https://cognysolutions.com) and worked with [access for everyone](https://a4e.org.in). before that, i held senior tech roles at [lvb](https://locatevictimsbeirut.org) and [sakshi](https://sakshi.org.in). i’ve built web platforms for nonprofits, startups, and community orgs. outside of work, i tinker with data and ml. i like building practical, user-first products and i’m usually turning messy requirements into something clean that actually ships.
